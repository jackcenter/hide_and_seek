# Hide and Seek
Hide and Seek is a project based on the paper "Distributed Data Fusion" by Mark Campbell and Nisar Ahmed. The purpose of
this project is to show how information can be shared among a network of agents to improve the state estimate of all 
agents on the network. To explore this, a simple example based on a game of hide and seek that continues to get more 
elaborate. Currently, the following examples are available:
1. Static Process, Stationary Linear Sensors

## How to Install
